# docker-nginx-reverse-proxy
Boilerplate reverse proxy server using Nginx, React, and FastAPI.

## Development
1. `git clone https://github.com/WojoSite/docker-nginx-reverse-proxy.git`
2. `docker-compose up`
3. Navigate to [localhost](http://localhost/)

#### Notes
The `reverse_proxy/nginx.conf` has some commented out directives I was playing around with to learn more Nginx performance and security.
